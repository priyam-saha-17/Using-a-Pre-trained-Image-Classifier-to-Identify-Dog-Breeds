## Using a Pre trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

### This is the first project under my UDACITY AI Programming with Python Nanodegree [ received as scholarship via AWS DeepRacer Student League 2022 ]



## Objectives of Project


1. Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs and which  aren't of dogs.

2. Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that classified as dogs.

3. Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG) works fastest and achieves greatest accuracy in pursuit of objectives 1 and 2.

4. Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms takes to run.


## Project Outline


1. Time your program.
2. Get program Inputs from the user [ check uploaded_images folder ].
3. Create Pet Images Labels, ie, the ground truth [ from the file names (under uploaded_images folder) ].
4. Create Classifier Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs".
5. Compare these Classifier Labels with the ground truth.
6. Calculate the Results ( Percentage of perfect matches and also the overall time taken by the architechture ).
7. Print the Results.
