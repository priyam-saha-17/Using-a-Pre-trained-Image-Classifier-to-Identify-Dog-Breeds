Answer:	

I found Resnet to be the best performing CNN architechture comapared to the other two , though all three classified my dog image accurately as "golden retriever". 

Amongst the three models, Alexnet was the fastest (1 sec) but it wrongly classified the "pen" as a "broom". So , it has a lower depth of accuracy compared to Resnet and Vgg.

Resnet took 2 seconds but the classifier labels accurately identified the images.

Vgg also made accurate classifier labels but took much more time (5 seconds).

So, keeping in mind the time consumed and accuracy , Resnet has the best performance.
